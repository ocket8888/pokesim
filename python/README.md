# pokesim
This package contains a playable pokemon battle simulation game. Currently supports only a small part of one Pokemon's moveset. Aims for Gen VII compatibility; future generations are not guaranteed to be playable. Also will not feature Mega Evolutions or Z-Moves for the forseeable future. Double, Triple, Rotation and other misc. battle types are a huge stretch goal, behind supporting multi-Pokemon teams.

## Installation
The easiest way to install is with `pip`. If your pip installs for python 3.6+, simply enter
```
pip install pokesim
```
at the command line. To install manually, download this repo and run
```
python setup.py install
```
